  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural
      Statistics Service (NASS) conducted an Agricultural Census in 2012.  The
      statistical census data are summarized at the state, county, and U.S. levels
      and are available in a digital format.  The Research and Development Division
      of NASS modified generalized state boundaries to show geographic areas for
      which the 2012 Agricultural Census statistics are reported at the state
      level.  These state-level boundary files were used in the production of
      the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Agricultural Atlas of the United States.
      The boundary files can be employed in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
      with the 2012 Agricultural Census statistical data by using the Agricultural
      Census state codes to associate the state-level spatial entities with the
      state-level statistical data.
    Purpose:
      The boundaries are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state
      level.  The boundary data are designed for small scale thematic mapping
      applications at a scale of 1:20,000,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:50,000,000, etc.).
      The state-level boundaries are provided "as is".  The USDA/NASS does not
      warrant the results you may obtain using the Agricultural Census state-level
      boundary data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These Agricultural Census state-level boundary files may be used with statistical
      data in the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series,
      Parts 1 - 50, 52.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Unmodified entities have entity codes and names which conform to
      the Federal Information Processing Standard 5-2.  Area values in
      square miles are derived from land polygon area values from the
      U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No topological checks were performed on the data.
  Completeness_Report:
    The generalized data do NOT include 1) boundaries for the Aleutian
    Islands in the Eastern Hemisphere, 2) boundaries for Hawaiian Islands
    west of -160.555771 degrees longitude, 3) very small polygons because of
    coordinate thinning, and 4) water polygons.  This data set provides the
    land area in square miles and number of acres for each state equivalent.
    The land area values are based on the area of land polygons from the U.S.
    Census Bureau's TIGER database.  If a state is composed of several polygons,
    the area value assigned to each polygon is the land area value of the entire
    state (for the purpose of choropleth mapping).  The state-level boundary for
    Maryland was modified to include the District of Columbia (D.C.), because
    Agricultural Census data for D.C. are not reported separately.  State-level
    Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes are used to identify states.
    Because Maryland and D.C. state boundaries were aggregated, Maryland's FIPS
    code 24 represents Maryland (24) and D.C. (11).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The state-level boundary data are highly generalized and suitable
        for use in small scale (1:20,000,000) thematic mapping applications.
        No accuracy tests were performed.
